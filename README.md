<h1 algin="center">Hello World</h1>
I am a freshly graduated software engineer who is eager to find a job where I could use my skills and develop new ones. I graduated in June with 2:1, and Iâ€™m currently looking for jobs in the UK and Poland. 

In my graduate studies at Solent University, I had many various opportunities to develop further skills, such as working in a team, meeting a deadline and the quality of the code. 

In my studies I learned new technologies with some frameworks such as : 
Python - Flask, NumPy, Pandas, Beautiful Soup 4
JavaScript - Node.js, API
Java- OOD, Junit Testing
